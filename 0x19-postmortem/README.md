Issue Summary:
Duration:
Start Time: May 10, 2024, 08:00 UTC End Time: May 10, 2024, 14:00 UTC Impact:
The web application's login functionality was unavailable for all users. Users experienced an inability to log in, resulting in a 30% decrease in user activity during the outage period. Root Cause:
The outage was caused by a misconfiguration in the authentication service, specifically a token expiration issue. Timeline:
08:15 UTC: Issue detected through monitoring alerts indicating a high volume of failed login attempts. 08:20 UTC: Engineering team notified of the issue. 08:30 UTC: Investigation begins, focusing on recent changes to the authentication service and database. 09:00 UTC: Initial assumption made that the database was overloaded due to increased traffic. 09:30 UTC: Further investigation reveals misconfigured token expiration settings. 10:00 UTC: Incident escalated to the DevOps team for additional support. 11:30 UTC: DevOps team assists in identifying the root cause and devising a solution. 12:30 UTC: Solution implemented to adjust token expiration settings. 13:00 UTC: Verification testing conducted to ensure the issue is resolved. 14:00 UTC: Web application login functionality restored. Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause:
The issue stemmed from misconfigured token expiration settings in the authentication service. Tokens were expiring prematurely, causing login failures. Resolution:
The problem was fixed by adjusting the token expiration settings to align with the intended user session duration. This ensured that users' login sessions persisted as expected. Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Improvements/Fixes:
Implement regular audits of configuration settings to catch discrepancies early. Enhance monitoring to proactively detect anomalies in authentication processes. Tasks to Address the Issue:
Conduct a thorough review of all service configuration settings. Document and standardize token expiration policies across services. Implement automated tests to validate authentication functionality after configuration changes. This postmortem provides a detailed account of the outage, its impact, the steps taken to resolve it, and measures to prevent similar incidents in the future.
